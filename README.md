### Working with Polymorphism 

`Abstract methods`

A method without body (no implementation) is known as `abstract method`. A method must always be declared in an abstract class, or in other words you can say that if a class has an abstract method, it should be declared abstract as well.


Make a program to read data from N pictures (N provided by the user), and then show the areas of these figures in the same order in which they were typed.

Enter the number of shapes: 2\
Shape #1 data:\
Rectangle or Circle (r/c)? R\
Color (BLACK/BLUE/RED): BLACK\
Width: 4.0\
Height: 5.0\
Shape #2 data:\
Rectangle or Circle (r/c)? C\
Color (BLACK/BLUE/RED): RED\
Radius: 3.0

SHAPE AREAS:\
Circle: 28.27 
Rectangle: 20.00
